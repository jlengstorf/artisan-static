The included files related to Netlify CMS should work out of the box.

Just make sure that your [Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity) settings and [Git Gateway](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/git-gateway) settings are correctly configured.

You can change the Netlify CMS version being used in `config.php` under the `services` key.

Navigate to `yoursite.netlify.app/admin` to access the CMS.
