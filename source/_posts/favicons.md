Recommendation: [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net)

You should put all of your favicon-related files in `source/_assets/favicons`.

They will be automatically copied into the root of the build directory.

Go to `source/_partials/head/favicon.blade.php` to change the favicon HTML code.
